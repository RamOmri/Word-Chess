# Word-Chess
An implementation of a game called word-chess. The aim of this game is to turn one word into another by only changing one letter at a time. The two words entered must exist

To run the program first open the terminal in the root directory. Compile by calling ```javac WordChessImp.java``` . Then you can run the program by calling ```java WordChessImp``` followed by two real words of the same length. For example:
    
    java WordChessImp word root
If no path exists between the two words then the program will simply exit. If a path does exist then the shortest path between the two words will be printed onto the terminal
